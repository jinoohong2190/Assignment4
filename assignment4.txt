1.  How can you concatenate strings in C? 
	Use the strcat(string1,string2) function to concatenate 2 strings.

2.  If a static array is not initialized, what will the size automatically be set to? 
	A size will not be set. You can check this with the sizeof() function that will then create an error.

3.  How would you declare a multidimensional array of size 64? Explain your answer. 
You need to provide 2 pieces of data when creating an array. For example: int array[2][32];


4.  In your own words, explain what each of the following functions does and returns:
      - strcmp() 
		This function compares two strings strcmp(string1,string2) and sees which string is bigger and smaller in terms of ASCII. If they are equal, strcmp(string1,string2) will equal zero.

      - fgets()
		fgets reads a string in from a source that the programmer tells it to. This source can be from the keyboard or a file.

      - strcat() 
		This function concatenates two strings

      - strlen()
		This finds the length of a string and NOT its size.
